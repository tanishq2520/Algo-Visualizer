### ## 📝 Project Overview

This repository contains simple Python implementations of common algorithms (sorting, searching, and pathfinding) along with visualizers to see them in action. The project uses Streamlit to provide an interactive web UI for easy demonstration. It's designed for **learning, teaching, and experimentation** and is a beginner-friendly project for Hacktoberfest!

---

### ## ✨ Features

* Lightweight algorithm implementations with generator-based frame output for visualization.
* Interactive web demo built with Streamlit (`main.py`).
* Example CLI/demo scripts under the `examples/` directory.
* A small test suite for core algorithms using Pytest.
* Beginner-friendly and Hacktoberfest ready! 🎃

### ## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

This project visually demonstrates the following algorithms:

| Algorithm          | Description                                                    | Time Complexity |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Bubble Sort** | A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list. | `O(n²)`         |
| **Insertion Sort** | Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.              | `O(n²)`         |
| **Selection Sort** | Repeatedly finds the minimum element and moves it to the front. | `O(n²)`         |
| **Binary Search** | An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list.   | `O(log n)`      |
| **BFS Pathfinding**| A Breadth-First Search demo for grid-based pathfinding.        | `O(V + E)`      |

### ## 🛠️ Installation & How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY_NAME].git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd [REPOSITORY_NAME]
    ```
3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment**
    ```sh
    # Create the venv
    python -m venv .venv
    
    # Windows
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

    # macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Run the Streamlit Visualizer**
    ```sh
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
    Now, open your browser to the local URL provided by Streamlit to see the application running.

### ## 🧩 How It Works

Each algorithm yields "frames" for visualization:
{
    'state': [5, 2, 4, 1, 3],
    'highlight': (i, j),
    'info': 'Comparing index i and j'
}
The Streamlit app renders these frames as bar charts, with playback speed adjustable by slider.
